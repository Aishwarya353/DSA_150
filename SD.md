Awesome — here are **4 really good, beginner‑friendly resources** (videos + blogs) for getting started with system design. These are great for when you’re “just looking at it” without heavy pressure.

1. **Video**: Gaurav Sen – *“System Design BASICS: Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling”*

   [System Design BASICS: Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling (Gaurav Sen)](https://glasp.co/youtube/xpDnVSmNFX0?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

   *Why it’s good:* Covers key scaling concepts (vertical/horizontal) in a simple way.
   *Tip:* Watch this and just try to **understand the high‑level idea** rather than memorizing every detail.

2. **Video**: freeCodeCamp.org – *“System Design for Beginners Course”*

   *Why it’s good:* A longer beginner‑friendly walkthrough of system design basics and patterns.
   *Tip:* Maybe just watch the first 30‑40 mins now, save the rest for later when you’re ready.

3. **Blog**: DesignGurus – “System Design Tutorial for Beginners (2025)”

   ([Design Gurus][1])
   *Why it’s good:* Written for beginners, explains core concepts like scalability, CAP theorem, etc.
   *Tip:* Read the first half now (why system design matters + key concepts), bookmark the rest.

4. **Blog**: Shivam Bhadani – “System Design For Beginners: Everything You Need in One Article”

   ([Medium][2])
   *Why it’s good:* A single article that covers many essentials in one place — good for a “view overview” session.
   *Tip:* Go through this when you have 20‑30 mins, just to get your mind exposed.

Feel free to pick **one** of these this week — maybe the blog or the shorter video — just to *get familiar*. Then we’ll add more slowly.
If you like, I can also pull **2‑3 more “easy view” resources** (10‑15 mins each) for your next couple of weekends.
